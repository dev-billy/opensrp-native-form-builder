# OpenSRP Native Form Builder

Native Form Builder is a builder for native forms used in OpenSRP Projects.

The project aims at helping people build and edit native forms easily without having to learn the verbose json structure used to buid these forms.

The project also helps in visualizing translations for forms

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

### `npm start`

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
